# nequip-extension-template
This repository serves as a minimal template for [`nequip`](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip) extension packages.
Its role is to provide the structure that can be used as the starting point of your `nequip` extension package.
This template should be used with reference to the [developer docs for extension packages](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/extension_packages.html).

Examples of `nequip` extension packages that can be used as references include
 - [Allegro](https://github.com/mir-group/allegro), an extension package that implements the strictly local equivariant model with excellent scalability for multirank molecular dynamics simulations.
 - [NequIP-LES](https://github.com/ChengUCB/NequIP-LES), an extension of NequIP and Allegro that adds long-range electrostatics via the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) algorithm.

## Licensing

Although `nequip` uses the MIT License, this template does not include a license file.
Developers creating extension packages should add a license before releasing their projects.
Unless you have a reason for choosing something different, we recommend the MIT License or something similarly permissive like the Apache 2.0 or BSD 3-Clause licenses.

## Join the NequIP Community

Extension package developers are invited to join us on the NequIP community chat server, which is hosted on the excellent [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) software.
Zulip is organized a little bit differently than chat software like Slack or Discord that you may be familiar with: please review [their introduction](https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-topics) before posting.
