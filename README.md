# nequip-extension-template
This repo serves as a minimal template for `nequip` extension packages.
Its role is to provide the structure that can be used as the starting point of your `nequip` extension package.
This template should be used with reference to the [developer docs for extension packages](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/extension_packages.html).
