# nequip-extension-template
This repo serves as a minimal template for `nequip` extension packages.
Its role is to provide the structure that can be used as the starting point of your `nequip` extension package.
This template should be used with reference to the [developer docs for extension packages](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/extension_packages.html).

Examples of `nequip` extension packages that can be used as references include
 - [Allegro](https://github.com/mir-group/allegro), an extension package that implements the strictly local equivariant model with excellent scalability for multirank molecular dynamics simulations.

Extension package developers are invited to join us on the NequIP community chat server, which is hosted on the excellent [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) software.
Zulip is organized a little bit differently than chat software like Slack or Discord that you may be familiar with: please review [their introduction](https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-topics) before posting.
